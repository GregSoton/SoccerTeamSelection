# Data-Driven Soccer Team Selection to Minimize Player Injuries and Maximize Team Performance

Player injuries in soccer can significantly impact long-term team performance both on and off the pitch. According to insurance brokers Howden, throughout the ‘Big Five’ leagues in the 2021/22 season, injury costs for clubs reached £513 million, a 29% increase on the previous season.  Despite this, we find that managers still tend to focus on short-term gains with "greedy" strategies, often playing star players when they are at high risk of injury. Therefore, we have developed a data-driven team selection strategy that considers player injury risk and match outcome probabilities, reducing player injuries while sustaining long-term team success.
